						<td>The site utilizes the "advanced grid" layout found in the 10 Rock Solid Website Layout Examples page. It is very information and visual heavy. It's somewhat reminiscent of a newspaper so I'd call it a bit more "mature" than many of the sites found here.   </td>
						<td>The website shines in terms of functionality. People visit it to get information and they will find a ton of it here. The main page shows the scheduled games for the day along with the scores while showing main headlines and featuring a main story with a large visual. </td>
						<td>This site features very little interactivity. The only example I can find is that links become underlined when hovered over with the mouse. </td>
						<td>It is pretty easy to get around the different pages. The Yahoo! sports logo is always at the top allowing the user to easily return to the main page. There's also a site map at the bottom of the page.</td>

						<td>I would describe Facebook's timeline redesign as being modern and somewhat visually striking. However, this will depends heavily on the user's customization of his or her own profile. </td>
						<td>I find the new design to be very functional. Above the fold, important user information such as their occupation, education, city of residence, and relationship details are featured prominently while wall posts are laid out below. </td>
						<td>There's a good amount of interactivity in the site. Various icons pop up when certain parts of the page are hovered over with the mouse. For exmaple, hovering over your profile picture gives you the option to change it. There are also little touches like pictures forming a border when moused over.</td>
						<td>Navigating around various pages is pretty easy. The famous Facebook bar is always found at the top of the page giving the user easy access to their own profile, the Facebook "home page", and the search bar to find other profiles of interest.</td>

						<td>This site is fun, modern, edgy, and very memorable. The very large background image catches your eye immediately while allowing relevant details to be easily found. </td>
						<td>This site is effective in showing who these guys are, what they do, and examples of their past work. </td>
						<td>There is a bit of interactivity in the site. The "See Work" button is slightly transparent unless hovered over where it becomes completely opaque. A small twist I found was that their links are underlined by defualt but become normal when moused over. </td>
						<td>Navigating the site is easy and simple. They feature their logo at the top of the webpage which easily allows the user to return to the home page. Unfortunately, you have to scroll to the bottom of the page to easily navigate to the other sections of the website. </td>

						<td>This is is very simple and minimalistic with its spartan layout and two tone color scheme with a large slideshow as the main feature. It is an example of the Featured Graphic layout in the rock solid design page. </td>

						<td>There is minimal interactivity in this website. The only example I can find is the links for the navigation bar at the top and bottom having a grey box appear behind a moused-over item.</td>

						<td>Navigating the site is easy. Dan Winters has a vast portfolio, but he has categorized all of his photos for easy navigation. There is a persistant navigation bar at the left of the page which features a bright red arrow pointing to the section the user is currently at.

						<td>The webpage is very clean, trendy, modern, and red. It features the Headline & Gallery rock solid layout.</td>
						<td>The site is very minimalistic and so it is easy to find the crucial information necessary in a portfolio such as their work, contact information, etc.</td>
						<td>The past work section of this site is pretty interesting. At rest, the thumbnails are overlaid with a deep red overlay. When the mouse hovers one, however, the red overlay disappears to show the image in its true colors. Clicking on the thumbnail causes a lightbox to "drop down" from the top of the page.</td>
						<td>The site is relatively easy to navigate in the beginning, but clicking on a link causes the browser to scroll down to the relevant section. In order to quickly jump to another section, the user must scroll all the way to the top of the page. It is easier to just scroll up or down to the desired section. When looking at a full size example of their work, the exit "X" is kind of small and blends in the with the background which made it frustrating to try and quit the full size lightbox view. </td>

						<td>This site is very modern and trendy. Being a fashion photographer's portfolio, the images are similarly flashy and the fact that they take up the entire page is very striking. </td>
						<td>The site prominently features the photographer's work well and allows users to learn more about him. However, there is slight bug that causes the top and bottom of the image to get cropped awkwardly when the window is resized to a widescreen aspect ratio. This is an odd oversight as most modern displays are wider than 4:3 these days. </td>
						<td>This is a bit of interactivity in this page. The photographs are in a slideshow, but it does not advance automatically. The user must manually click through every photo to see each one. I really like that you don't have to physically click the up or down arrows to navigate the photos. You can also press up and down on the keyboard or you can also scroll with the mousewheel. </td>
						<td>The fixed sidebar allows easy access to the three main sections of this website. </td>

						<td>This website's layout is clean, modern, and minimalistic but the sometimes disturbing photos clash with the layout theme. Nevertheless, I really like the horizontal scroll layout and I copied it for use in my own website. It's a bit of the remix of the fixed side bar layout.  </td>

						<td>This website is modern but features retro visuals. It is clean and uncluttered.</td>
						<td>The site shows various examples of the designer's past work as well as his blog, contact information, and items for sale. I would say that the site is very functional.</td>
						<td>The previous works page features a gallery of thumbnails that show a caption with the title of the work to show when moused over. Clicking on the thumbnail brings the user to a slideshow featuring a larger version of the image. I would have preferred a lightbox but this works fine.</td>

						<td>This site is very functional: It shows Vladimir's work and his biography and contact information.</td>
						<td>This website features nifty elements of interactivity. In the navigation bar, a red box appears below the name of the page the user is currently on. When the user hovers over another part of the site, the red box slides over to that link. Another example is the image that leads to the designer's digital portfolio. It is a pencil drawn laptop at rest, but when moused over the screen glows yellow. I really appreciated these little details.</td>
						<td>Navigation is simple. The navigation bar at the top of the allows the user to easily return home or to jump to the other sections of the site.</td>
